# Typing Speed Test Application

## Overview
This Typing Speed Test application is a web-based tool designed to measure a user's typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy. Users can test their typing skills against a randomly generated text, view their results, and compare their performance on a leaderboard.

1. **Dynamic Typing Test:**
   - Displays a randomly fetched paragraph for users to type.
   - Highlights correct and incorrect letters in green and red, respectively.

2. **Live Metrics:**
   - Tracks and displays real-time typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy percentage.

3. **Stopwatch:**
   - Starts automatically when the user begins typing.
   - Records the elapsed time for the test.

4. **Completion Detection:**
   - Automatically ends the test when the user types all characters in the given text.

5. **Leaderboard:**
   - Stores the top 5 scores in the browserâ€™s local storage.
   - Displays username, typing speed, and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
1. **HTML:** For structuring the user interface.
2. **CSS:** For styling the application (via `style.css`).
3. **JavaScript:** For dynamic behavior, stopwatch functionality, real-time performance tracking, and local storage management.

- Initializes the text to type and resets metrics.

### 2. Stopwatch
- Tracks elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates every second during the test.

### 3. Typing Metrics
- **Accuracy:** Calculated as `(Correct Characters / Total Typed Characters) * 100`.
- **Speed:** Measured in words per minute based on the elapsed time.

### 4. Leaderboard
- Stores top 5 scores locally using `localStorage`.
- Displays the leaderboard dynamically.

## Additional Features
- **Auto-Completion:** Automatically stops the test and displays results when the user finishes typing the text.
- **Error Handling:** Alerts the user if the test is submitted without typing.
- **Text Highlighting:** Differentiates correct and incorrect characters visually.
